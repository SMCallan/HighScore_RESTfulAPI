Before diving into the testing phase, it's prudent to ensure all necessary resources and tools are available and set up properly. Here’s a feasibility and resource requirement outline for the High Score project:

### **Feasibility and Resource Requirements**

#### **Development Environment:**

1. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):**
   - **IntelliJ IDEA:** An IDE that supports Spring Boot and Java development, equipped with features like code completion, debugging, and version control integration.
   
2. **Version Control System:**
   - **Git:** A distributed version control system to track changes, collaborate, and manage the project’s source code.

3. **Build Tool:**
   - **Maven:** A build automation tool used for managing dependencies, building, testing, and packaging the project.

#### **Dependencies:**

1. **Spring Boot:** 
   - A framework to ease the bootstrapping and development of new Spring applications.
   
2. **Spring Web:**
   - A module to develop web applications using Spring MVC.
   
3. **Spring Data JPA:**
   - A module to ease data access within the application, providing a link between the application and databases.
   
4. **H2 Database:**
   - An in-memory database for testing database interactions.
   
5. **JUnit:**
   - A testing framework for Java applications to write and run repeatable tests.
   
6. **Mockito:**
   - A mocking framework used to write simple and clean tests.

#### **Testing Tools:**

1. **Postman:**
   - A tool for testing API endpoints.

2. **Spring Boot Test:**
   - A module for testing Spring components with JUnit or other testing frameworks.

#### **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**

1. **Jenkins or GitHub Actions:**
   - Tools for automating the building, testing, and deployment of the project.

#### **Monitoring and Logging:**

1. **Logback or SLF4J:**
   - Logging frameworks to monitor the system behavior and aid in debugging.

#### **Documentation:**

1. **Markdown Editor:**
   - Tools like Typora or a Markdown plugin in IntelliJ IDEA for writing and maintaining the project documentation.

2. **Swagger:**
   - A tool for API documentation that also provides testing and interaction with the API endpoints.

#### **Future Considerations:**

1. **Docker:**
   - For containerizing the application, ensuring it runs the same regardless of where it’s deployed.

2. **Spring Security:**
   - For implementing security features like authentication and authorization in later phases of the project.

3. **React, Angular, or Vue:**
   - Front-end frameworks for developing a user interface in the future if required.

This outline encapsulates the primary resources and tools required for the High Score project, ensuring a smooth progression from development to testing, and eventually to deployment and scaling. Each resource and tool has been selected to provide a robust, scalable, and manageable development environment, facilitating the efficient realization of the project’s goals.
