## Step 1: Project Setup and Initial Commit

- We initiated a new Spring Boot project via IntelliJ's Spring Initializr.
- The project was configured with dependencies for Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and H2 Database.
- Initialized a Git repository and made an initial commit.

## Step 2: Data Model Creation

Created a `HighScore` entity in the `model` package. It has the following fields:

- `id`: Primary Key, auto-generated.
- `playerName`: Stores the name of the player.
- `score`: Stores the high score.

Added JPA annotations for entity definition and primary key. Also generated getters and setters for these fields.


### Step 3: Creating the Repository Layer
- [x] Created a new package named `repository` under `com.csm.highscore.gamehighscore`.
- [x] Created a new Java interface named `HighScoreRepository`.
- [x] Extended `JpaRepository` to enable CRUD operations for `HighScore` entities.

### Step 4: Creating the Controller Layer

- [x] Created a new package named `controller` under `com.csm.highscore.gamehighscore`.
- [x] Created a new Java class named `HighScoreController` within the `controller` package.
- [x] Annotated the class with `@RestController` and `@RequestMapping`.
- [x] Implemented dependency injection for `HighScoreRepository`.

### Step 5: Implementing the Service Layer

- [x] Created a new package named `service` under `com.csm.highscore.gamehighscore`.
- [x] Defined a new Java interface named `HighScoreService` within the `service` package.
- [x] Created a new Java class named `HighScoreServiceImpl` within the `service` package.
- [x] Implemented the `HighScoreService` interface in `HighScoreServiceImpl`.
- [x] Annotated the class with `@Service`.
- [x] Implemented dependency injection for `HighScoreRepository` within `HighScoreServiceImpl`.

### Step 6: Implementing RESTful Endpoints

- [x] Implemented RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations in `HighScoreController`.
- [x] Used `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping`, and `@DeleteMapping` annotations.
- [x] Tested endpoints with Postman.

### Step 7: Implementing the Service Layer

- [x] Implemented the `HighScoreService` interface in the `HighScoreServiceImpl` class.
- [x] Methods of `HighScoreService` are implemented by delegating the tasks to `HighScoreRepository`.

## Next Steps

Up to this point, you've set up a basic Spring Boot application with a layered architecture. This includes a model, repository, service, and controller, along with implementing CRUD operations.

### Additional Considerations

Here are some additional steps you might consider:

1. **Exception Handling**: Implement global exception handling for your REST API.
2. **Logging**: Add logging capabilities to keep track of what's happening during execution.
3. **Security**: Implement security features like authentication and authorization.
4. **Front-End**: If your application needs a user interface, this would be the time to start implementing it.
5. **Deployment**: Once everything is set, you may want to look into deploying your application.
6. **Testing**: Write unit and integration tests to make sure everything is working as expected.

Testing is a crucial aspect of any software project, especially when aiming for high code quality and reliability. In a Spring Boot application, there are several layers that can be tested:

1. **Unit Tests**: For individual components like models, repositories, and utility classes.
2. **Integration Tests**: For testing the interactions between components and can include database interactions.
3. **Functional Tests**: For testing complete functionality of some application areas.
4. **End-to-End Tests**: For testing the flow of an application from start to finish.

Given that our project is focused on a RESTful API for game high scores, here are some tests that would make sense at each layer.

### Suggested Roadmap for Testing

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- [ ] **Model**: Test the `HighScore` entity to ensure that it can be created and manipulated as expected.
- [ ] **Repository**: Mock the `HighScoreRepository` and test CRUD operations.
- [ ] **Service**: Mock the `HighScoreService` and test its methods to ensure they interact correctly with the repository.

### Integration Tests

- [ ] **Controller & Service**: Test the `HighScoreController` along with the `HighScoreService` to ensure they work as expected together.
- [ ] **Database**: Write tests to check if CRUD operations are affecting the database as expected.

### Functional Tests

- [ ] **Endpoints**: Use tools like Postman to manually test your API endpoints.
- [ ] **Validation**: Test if the system correctly validates incoming data (like incorrect formats, null values, etc.)

### End-to-End Tests

- [ ] **User Flows**: Test typical user flows like adding a new high score, updating it, and deleting it.

### Additional Considerations

1. **Exception Handling**: Ensure that your tests cover exceptional cases and that your API responds with the correct error codes and messages.
2. **Logging**: Test if logging is performed where necessary.
3. **Security**: Test for common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), etc.
