## Step 1: Project Setup and Initial Commit

- We initiated a new Spring Boot project via IntelliJ's Spring Initializr.
- The project was configured with dependencies for Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and H2 Database.
- Initialized a Git repository and made an initial commit.

## Step 2: Data Model Creation

Created a `HighScore` entity in the `model` package. It has the following fields:

- `id`: Primary Key, auto-generated.
- `playerName`: Stores the name of the player.
- `score`: Stores the high score.

Added JPA annotations for entity definition and primary key. Also generated getters and setters for these fields.


### Step 3: Creating the Repository Layer
- [x] Created a new package named `repository` under `com.csm.highscore.gamehighscore`.
- [x] Created a new Java interface named `HighScoreRepository`.
- [x] Extended `JpaRepository` to enable CRUD operations for `HighScore` entities.

### Step 4: Creating the Controller Layer

- [x] Created a new package named `controller` under `com.csm.highscore.gamehighscore`.
- [x] Created a new Java class named `HighScoreController` within the `controller` package.
- [x] Annotated the class with `@RestController` and `@RequestMapping`.
- [x] Implemented dependency injection for `HighScoreRepository`.

### Step 5: Implementing the Service Layer

- [x] Created a new package named `service` under `com.csm.highscore.gamehighscore`.
- [x] Defined a new Java interface named `HighScoreService` within the `service` package.
- [x] Created a new Java class named `HighScoreServiceImpl` within the `service` package.
- [x] Implemented the `HighScoreService` interface in `HighScoreServiceImpl`.
- [x] Annotated the class with `@Service`.
- [x] Implemented dependency injection for `HighScoreRepository` within `HighScoreServiceImpl`.

### Step 6: Implementing RESTful Endpoints

- [x] Implemented RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations in `HighScoreController`.
- [x] Used `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping`, and `@DeleteMapping` annotations.
- [x] Tested endpoints with Postman.

### Step 7: Implementing the Service Layer

- [x] Implemented the `HighScoreService` interface in the `HighScoreServiceImpl` class.
- [x] Methods of `HighScoreService` are implemented by delegating the tasks to `HighScoreRepository`.

## Next Steps

Up to this point, you've set up a basic Spring Boot application with a layered architecture. This includes a model, repository, service, and controller, along with implementing CRUD operations.

### Additional Considerations

Here are some additional steps you might consider:

1. **Exception Handling**: Implement global exception handling for your REST API.
2. **Logging**: Add logging capabilities to keep track of what's happening during execution.
3. **Security**: Implement security features like authentication and authorization.
4. **Front-End**: If your application needs a user interface, this would be the time to start implementing it.
5. **Deployment**: Once everything is set, you may want to look into deploying your application.
6. **Testing**: Write unit and integration tests to make sure everything is working as expected.

## Next Development Phases Roadmap

### Phase 1: Safety Net and Resilience

#### 1.1 Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for all existing functionalities.
- [ ] Implement integration tests to ensure complete flow of application.

#### 1.2 Exception Handling
- [ ] Implement global exception handling for application robustness.
- [ ] Provide meaningful error messages for debugging and client understanding.

### Phase 2: Operational Awareness

#### 2.1 Logging
- [ ] Implement logging mechanisms for debugging and tracking.
- [ ] Use logs to gather insights into application performance and user behavior.

### Phase 3: Security Measures

#### 3.1 Security
- [ ] Implement basic authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- [ ] Use OAuth or JWT for token-based authentication.

### Phase 4: User Interface

#### 4.1 Front-End
- [ ] Start implementing the front-end once back-end is stable.
- [ ] Use frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue for robustness and scalability.

### Phase 5: Preparing for Production

#### 5.1 Deployment
- [ ] Decide on a deployment strategy.
- [ ] Use containerization tools like Docker for easier deployment and scaling.

### Phase 6: Iterative Improvements

- [ ] Refine and expand upon all the above features.
- [ ] Consider more advanced security measures such as rate-limiting and data encryption.
- [ ] Optimize logging and monitoring based on real-world usage.

### Phase 7: Additional Testing

- [ ] Continuously update the test suite for new features and improvements.
- [ ] Implement E2E tests for full flow validation.

Testing is a crucial aspect of any software project, especially when aiming for high code quality and reliability. In a Spring Boot application, there are several layers that can be tested:

1. **Unit Tests**: For individual components like models, repositories, and utility classes.
2. **Integration Tests**: For testing the interactions between components and can include database interactions.
3. **Functional Tests**: For testing complete functionality of some application areas.
4. **End-to-End Tests**: For testing the flow of an application from start to finish.

Given that our project is focused on a RESTful API for game high scores, here are some tests that would make sense at each layer.

### Suggested Roadmap for Testing


---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- [ ] **Model**: Test the `HighScore` entity to ensure that it can be created and manipulated as expected.
- [ ] **Repository**: Mock the `HighScoreRepository` and test CRUD operations.
- [ ] **Service**: Mock the `HighScoreService` and test its methods to ensure they interact correctly with the repository.

### Integration Tests

- [ ] **Controller & Service**: Test the `HighScoreController` along with the `HighScoreService` to ensure they work as expected together.
- [ ] **Database**: Write tests to check if CRUD operations are affecting the database as expected.

### Functional Tests

- [ ] **Endpoints**: Use tools like Postman to manually test your API endpoints.
- [ ] **Validation**: Test if the system correctly validates incoming data (like incorrect formats, null values, etc.)

### End-to-End Tests

- [ ] **User Flows**: Test typical user flows like adding a new high score, updating it, and deleting it.

### Additional Considerations

1. **Exception Handling**: Ensure that your tests cover exceptional cases and that your API responds with the correct error codes and messages.
2. **Logging**: Test if logging is performed where necessary.
3. **Security**: Test for common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), etc.

By adopting a comprehensive testing strategy like the one above, you'll not only catch bugs early but also make it easier to integrate new features or make changes to existing ones in the future. Given that we're working on an enterprise project, adopting such a rigorous testing methodology demonstrates best practices in software engineering.
