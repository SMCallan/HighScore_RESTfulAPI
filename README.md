## Step 1: Project Setup and Initial Commit

- We initiated a new Spring Boot project via IntelliJ's Spring Initializr.
- The project was configured with dependencies for Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and H2 Database.
- Initialized a Git repository and made an initial commit.

## Step 2: Data Model Creation

Created a `HighScore` entity in the `model` package. It has the following fields:

- `id`: Primary Key, auto-generated.
- `playerName`: Stores the name of the player.
- `score`: Stores the high score.

Added JPA annotations for entity definition and primary key. Also generated getters and setters for these fields.


### Step 3: Creating the Repository Layer
- [x] Created a new package named `repository` under `com.csm.highscore.gamehighscore`.
- [x] Created a new Java interface named `HighScoreRepository`.
- [x] Extended `JpaRepository` to enable CRUD operations for `HighScore` entities.

### Step 4: Creating the Controller Layer

- [x] Created a new package named `controller` under `com.csm.highscore.gamehighscore`.
- [x] Created a new Java class named `HighScoreController` within the `controller` package.
- [x] Annotated the class with `@RestController` and `@RequestMapping`.
- [x] Implemented dependency injection for `HighScoreRepository`.

### Step 5: Implementing the Service Layer

- [x] Created a new package named `service` under `com.csm.highscore.gamehighscore`.
- [x] Defined a new Java interface named `HighScoreService` within the `service` package.
- [x] Created a new Java class named `HighScoreServiceImpl` within the `service` package.
- [x] Implemented the `HighScoreService` interface in `HighScoreServiceImpl`.
- [x] Annotated the class with `@Service`.
- [x] Implemented dependency injection for `HighScoreRepository` within `HighScoreServiceImpl`.

### Step 6: Implementing RESTful Endpoints

- [x] Implemented RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations in `HighScoreController`.
- [x] Used `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping`, and `@DeleteMapping` annotations.
- [x] Tested endpoints with Postman.

### Step 7: Implementing the Service Layer

- [x] Implemented the `HighScoreService` interface in the `HighScoreServiceImpl` class.
- [x] Methods of `HighScoreService` are implemented by delegating the tasks to `HighScoreRepository`.

## Next Steps

Up to this point, you've set up a basic Spring Boot application with a layered architecture. This includes a model, repository, service, and controller, along with implementing CRUD operations.

### Additional Considerations

Here are some additional steps you might consider:

1. **Exception Handling**: Implement global exception handling for your REST API.
2. **Logging**: Add logging capabilities to keep track of what's happening during execution.
3. **Security**: Implement security features like authentication and authorization.
4. **Front-End**: If your application needs a user interface, this would be the time to start implementing it.
5. **Deployment**: Once everything is set, you may want to look into deploying your application.
6. **Testing**: Write unit and integration tests to make sure everything is working as expected.
